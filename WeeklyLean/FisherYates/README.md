# Fisher-Yates Shuffle
The [Fisher-Yates Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) algorithm shuffles an array *in place* via randomly swapping elements. The algorithm guarentees that every permutation of the array is equally likely.     

## Challenge
**Prove That:**
- The Fisher-Yates Shuffle yeilds an unbiased permutation 

**Extract:**
- Your implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle into `C` such that the shuffle remains in-place in the extracted code.
