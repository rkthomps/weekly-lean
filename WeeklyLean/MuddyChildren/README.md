# Muddy Children
This week's challenge is centered around the [Muddy Children Problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-epistemic/appendix-B-solutions.html).

The objectives of the challenge are to:
- Model the muddy children problem in lean. 
- Conjecture and prove theorems relating the number of muddy children to the rounds in which they step forward.
